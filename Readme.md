The Classroom Scheduler is a simple program that creates an optimal schedule of courses given at University of Maryland: Baltimore County. The system accommodates the instructor’s classroom preferences to find the best fit for the courses they are teaching. The program achieves this by comparing attributes of the classrooms and the potential courses that can be taught in each room.The main constraints in determining the best classroom for each course include the distance between the classroom and the instructor’s office, timing, and the course capacity. Finding the classroom with the shortest distance is the first priority since the professor would not want to travel far across campus away from their office. The second priority is the timing to ensure that all classes do not overlap each other. The third priority is the size of the classroom to ensure that each room can accomodate the course capacity and the classroom’s resources are efficiently utilized. 

To find an optimal solution, Google’s OR-Tools was implemented into the program. OR-Tools is an open source software suite used for optimizing and includes a constraint programming solver that the program uses. This manual covers the installation process for OR-tools and Jupyter Notebooks, routine tasks performed by the program, and troubleshooting and errors that a user may encounter.
